# Motivation 
A person needs to send multiple files by email to a system, but each file must be sent in an individual message because the system reads the attached file and uses it to update the data.

# Objective

- Send bulk emails to the same recipient and with a different attachment in each message. The code needs to read all files with a specific extension within a directory and send them all by attachment. File by file.
